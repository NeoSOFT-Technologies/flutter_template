# Themes

This package is a module to help us manages multiple themes or Dark/Light theme functionality in a Flutter app.

## Setup

Add the themes package to the pubspec.yaml file

```yaml
dependencies:
  ...
  themes:
```

This package provides some basic classes to make theme management easier when building your flutter application. `themes` provides you with the basic functionality of swapping out the ThemeData provided to your app, which can be accessed using `Theme.of(context)`. In addition to that it also provides you with an helper function where you can change your status bar color. Lets take a look at the code.

## Usage

The package makes use of a `ThemeManager` to manage all the theme functionalities. To start off we have to call the initialise function of the `ThemeManager` before the app is started. Change your main function to return a `Future` and, make it async and await the initialise static function call on `ThemeManager`.

```dart
Future main() async {
  await ThemeManager.initialise();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

### Theme Builder

We start by wrapping our `MaterialApp` or any other `App` with our `ThemeBuilder`. The builder function returns a context, regularTheme, darkTheme and a themeMode. We supply this to the `MaterialApp`.

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ThemeBuilder(
      builder: (context, regularTheme, darkTheme, themeMode) => MaterialApp(
        title: 'Flutter Demo',
        theme: regularTheme,
        darkTheme: darkTheme,
        themeMode: themeMode,
        ...
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This will rebuild your app and pass a new theme through the context for you to use within your application.

### Supply Multiple Themes

The `ThemeBuilder` has a property called themes where you can supply a list of `ThemeData`. This is usually only 2 or 3, light, dark, neutral but we’re keeping it a list so you can have as many as you’d like. To keep things clean we will return the list of themes from a function created in a different file. Create a new file called `theme_setup.dart` . You can place it in the UI folders root location or leave it in root of lib. I haven’t decided where it’s the best yet so it's up to you

```dart
List<ThemeData> getThemes() {
  return [
    ThemeData(backgroundColor: Colors.blue, accentColor: Colors.yellow),
    ThemeData(backgroundColor: Colors.white, accentColor: Colors.green),
    ThemeData(backgroundColor: Colors.purple, accentColor: Colors.green),
    ThemeData(backgroundColor: Colors.black, accentColor: Colors.red),
    ThemeData(backgroundColor: Colors.red, accentColor: Colors.blue),
  ];
}
```

This is a pretty simple function but can start to look quite busy given how many of the theme properties you will use in your Themes. Which is why I recommend you keep it in a separate file. Go back to your main.dart file and supply the `getThemes()` value to the `themes` property of the `ThemeBuilder`.

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return ThemeBuilder(
    themes: getThemes(),
    builder: (context, regularTheme, darkTheme, themeMode) => MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: regularTheme,
      darkTheme: darkTheme,
      themeMode: themeMode,
      ...
    ),
  );
}
```

The way we swap between themes is by setting the index of the theme we want to use. It will start off with the first theme in the list. To update the theme to any other theme all you have to do in the UI is call `ThemeManager.of(context)` to get the `ThemeManager` and then call `selectThemeAtIndex(1)` on it. This is the code to select the second theme in the list of themes supplied.

```dart
ThemeManager.of(context)
  .selectThemeAtIndex(1);
```

You can get the currently selected theme index by using the `selectedThemeIndex` property of `ThemeManager`.

```dart
ThemeManager.of(context).selectedThemeIndex;
```

This will return the index of the currently enabled theme.

### Light and Dark

If you only want to use Light and Dark themes then you can supply that to the `ThemeBuilder` instead of supplying multiple themes. When supplying Light and Dark themes you can also supply a defaultThemeMode, which is `ThemeMode.system` by default. When you leave it as `system` you're telling the `ThemeManager` that you want the system to determine if you're using light or dark mode. This is how you would supply your dark and light theme.

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return ThemeBuilder(
    defaultThemeMode: ThemeMode.light,
    darkTheme: ThemeData(
      brightness: Brightness.dark,
      backgroundColor: Colors.blue[700],
      accentColor: Colors.yellow[700],
    ),
    lightTheme: ThemeData(
      brightness: Brightness.light,
      backgroundColor: Colors.blue[300],
      accentColor: Colors.yellow[300],
    ),
    builder: (context, regularTheme, darkTheme, themeMode) => MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: regularTheme,
      darkTheme: darkTheme,
      themeMode: themeMode,
      ...
    ),
  );
}
```

To toggle between light and dark mode you can use the `toggleDarkLightTheme` function on the `ThemeManager`.

```
ThemeManager.of(context)
  .toggleDarkLightTheme();
```

In addition to toggling the theme you can also use the `setThemeMode` function to set the `ThemeMode` on the `ThemeManager`.

```dart
ThemeManager.of(context)
  .setThemeMode(ThemeMode.light);
```

The `ThemeManager` will remember the last set value and broadcast that the next time the `ThemeManager` is constructed.

### Changing status bar color

Sometimes you want to status bar color to change as well when you have a specific theme. Most apps leave this transparent to make use of the backgrounds color. If your app requires you to change the status bar color there’s functionality for that as well. The `ThemeBuilder` has a property `statusBarColorBuilder` which is a function that expects you to return a `Color`. It provides you with the theme to be selected and you can use that to return the color you’d like to show for your status bar.

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return ThemeBuilder(
    statusBarColorBuilder: (theme) => theme.accentColor,
    lightTheme: ThemeData(...),
    darkTheme: ThemeData(...),
    ...
  );
}
```

In the case above we return the accentColor of the theme for the statusbar color. This functionality will automatically check if the status text is visible and will change the text from either white to black depending on the backgrounds value intensity (how close it is to white / black).

### Theme Persistence

If any of the themes are changed by the user during the lifetime of the app the theme that was last selected will automatically be applied when the app starts up again. This functionality is created through using the [shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) package.



## Using a Theme

Now that you’ve setup all your theme functionality lets look at how to use it in your UI. The first thing to know is you can access your theme data the normal way.

```dart
var theme = Theme.of(context);
```

This means the rest of your Flutter code still stays the same.

### Access in Business Logic

As you know. One of the rules I stick too is that there should be no UI related code or classes making use of the UI directly in any of your business logic. For that reason there is also a `ThemeService` which will allow you to call the same functions required to change between themes. This service should be used as any of the other stacked_services that you’ve used in the past. First we register it with the locator.

```dart
locator.registerSingleton(() => ThemeService.getInstance());

// or add it to your third_party_services_module if you’re using injectable
```

Then use it in the `ViewModel` or other services by getting it from the `locator`. And that’s it.
